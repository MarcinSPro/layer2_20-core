## Layer2-20

> Layer2-20, the first based on the [Orbiter Inscription Cross-Rollup Protocol](https://github.com/Orbiter-Finance/client-monorepo/blob/inscription-protocol/README.md), has creatively defined Ethereum's Omni-inscription style. This enables developers to create and configure unified rollup inscriptions, truly unlocking the future potential of the inscription market, and spearheading the inscription revolution.
> 

### Key function

- **Deploy:** Determine the deployment of inscriptions across multiple networks and initialize Layer2-20's omni-inscriptions.
- **Mint:** Generate and distribute Layer2-20 inscriptions to users in a fair and democratic manner.
- **Transfer:** Facilitate the movement of Layer2-20 inscriptions within addresses on the same network.
- **Bridge:** Enable the transfer of Layer2-20 inscriptions between addresses across different networks.
- **More:** In the future, it can be integrated with multi-rollup ecosystem projects for diverse scenarios like trading, liquid staking, lending, and more.

## $L2

> L2, as the first Layer2-20 inscription, signifies the birth of the Omni-Inscription, introducing Ethereum and L2 liquidity, making $L2 compatible with the billion-dollar DeFi liquidity market.
> 
- **Total supply of $L2:** 10,000,000,000
- **Network deployment:** Arbitrum One, Optimism, Linea, zksync Era, Base, Polygon zkEvm and Scroll
- **Total number of inscriptions issued:** 10,000,000
- **Maximum tokens per inscription:** 1000
- **Special reward:** After the completion of Minting(100%), the top 1000 addresses ranked by the number of inscriptions held across each network will be granted early OG Passes. These passes will enable unlocking of special benefits associated with the Layer2-20 protocol in the future.
